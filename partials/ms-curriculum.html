	<h1>Zero Robotics Middle School Program</h2>
	<p><img src="/images/mscurriculum/SPHERES.jpg" width="400" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"></p>
	<p>Zero Robotics (ZR) is a programming competition where SPHERES satellites inside the International Space Station (ISS) are controlled by programs developed by YOU! You will create, edit, share, save, simulate, and submit programming code in order to accomplish whatever your given task is. After several rounds of competition&ndash;within the class and within your region&ndash;finalists will be selected to compete in a live championship aboard the ISS. An astronaut will use your code to conduct the championship competition in microgravity with a live broadcast!</p>
	<p>This five-week program was designed to engage middle school students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) through the ZR game. We hope to help you better understand this content by connecting it to something we think is pretty exciting: space! You'll also get the chance to learn about STEM careers so that you can understand the many interesting opportunities for success that STEM fields can offer. Most of all, we hope you have fun!</p>

	<h2>For Educators</h2>
	<p>The <a href="ZR_MS_EG_summer13.pdf" target='_blank'>Educator Guide</a> is designed to be read electronically using a pdf application, which allows external links to be included. Teaching from a printed version of the guide is not recommended as you will not be able to follow external links to activities and programming tutorials. </p>
	<p>Thanks to Natalie Brown for sharing this <a href="ZRIDEJeopardy.pptx">sample Jeopardy game</a> for use in "Reflection and Assessment." (See Natalie's <a href="Tips for using PowerPoint ZRIDEJeopardy.pdf">tips</a> for the game.)</p>
	<p>Companion student materials are available by week. Students will be invited to login to the ZR website to access and use these materials as they progress through the curriculum.</p>
