                    <p><b>A1:</b> Try one or both of the following solutions:</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Make sure you're on the correct website - <a href = "http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/">zerorobotics.mit.edu</a> - and not

                            <li> Make sure you are using the correct email username. Your username should be an email that can connect with Google. Usually that means a gmail account, though some other emails can also connect. Make sure you are signing in with the email you used to create the account (so if you didn't create the account with your professional or personal email address, don't try signing in with it).</li>

                    <p><b>A2:</b> Try opening the website in a private/incognito browsing window. If that doesn't work, clear the cookies and cache on your computer.  If you are using Chrome, you can do this by going to History â†’ 'Clear browsing data'. Make sure both 'Cookies and other site and plug-in data' and 'Cached images and files' are checked before you click 'Clear browsing data'.</p>

                    <p>If the student is over 13:</p>
                        <ul>

                <accordion-group heading="Problems Managing Your Team">
                    <p class="question"><b>Q1:</b> When I go to the manage teams page, there's no option for me to add my students to the team.</p>
                    <p><b>A1:</b> You will only be able to add students to your team if you are a lead educator. If you are the only lead educator on your team, but the site doesn't give you lead access, email your assigned ZR UROP student or the ZR Staff (<a href = "mailto:zerorobotics@mit.edu">zerorobotics@mit.edu</a>) your name, your site name, and your ZR Login email so that we can set you up as a team lead.</p>
                    <p>If there is another lead educator on your team, they have the ability to add you as a lead. Have the other lead educator log-on, go to the 'Manage Teams' page, add you as a member, and check the 'is lead?' box next to your email.</p> 
                    <p class="question"><b>Q2:</b> How can I check if I was successfully added to my team. Will I get an email?</p>
                    <p><b>A2:</b> No, you will not get a confirmation email when you are added to a team. Instead, you can check that you are on a team by going to the 'Manage Teams' page (found under the 'Tournaments' tab). Your team name should be listed the along with information about your site's location and the team roster (please note the 'Manage Teams' page for students will only display their team name and a button to remove themselves from the team if they wish).</p>

                <accordion-group heading="General IDE Problems">
                    <p class="question"><b>Q1:</b> I'm on the website and I don't see the tab to get to the IDE.</p>
                    <p><b>A1:</b> You can only access the IDE if you are signed in. If the website keeps logging you out automatically, you won't be able to see the button.  To fix this issue, please see <em>Login Problems Q2</em>.</p>

                <accordion-group heading="Lost Code Problems">
                    <p class="question"><b>Q1:</b> When I press a button and it doesn't work or when I get an error after trying to simulate and I have to reload the page, I either lose the edits I just made or even the whole code.</p>
                    <p><b>A1:</b> This usually happens if you aren't signed in, have briefly lost internet connection, or have left the project open for a long time without actually editing it. To solve this: When you're working in the IDE, make sure you're still logged in. If you are going to take a break from a project in the IDE, close the project by navigating to a different page and reopen it when you want to resume working on it.</p>
                    <p>If you continue to have problems regarding lost code, please email your assigned ZR UROP student or the ZR Staff (<a href = "mailto:zerorobotics@mit.edu">zerorobotics@mit.edu</a>) and we will help you fix the problem.</p>

                    <p class="question"><b>Q1:</b> When I try to simulate my project I get an error saying the server isn't responding.</p>  
                    <p><b>A1:</b> You may have an issue with your internet connection, especially if you have a bunch of people all trying to simulate at once. Try disconnecting then reconnecting to the Internet and try to make sure students stagger themselves when pressing the simulate button.</p>
                    <p class="question"><b>Q2:</b> I want to test my player with a standard player, but no standard player button/option appears in the Opponent section.</p>
                    <p><b>A2:</b> We are currently working on making the standard players available to test your code against. In the meantime, feel free to have your students set their projects against each other in intramural competitions.</p>

                    <p class="question"><b>Q1:</b> When I try to share a project with my team, a white 'Share with Team' box appears, but nothing happens when I press the blue 'Share' button.</p>
                    <p><b>A1:</b> The 'Share with Team' button is currently not functioning.  We are attempting to find a fix for it, but for the time being please use the 'Share Individually' button to share code with your team.</p>

                <accordion-group heading="Debug Problems">
                    <p class="question"><b>Q1:</b> When I use the DEBUG feature in my code it doesn't work in my simulation correctly. It either won't work at all or will start showing my messages halfway through the simulation or long after they are supposed to.</p> 
                    <p><b>A1:</b> We are aware that DEBUG is not working properly at the moment and we are attempting to fix it.</p>
                    <p>If you are trying to use the DEBUG function to figure out why you code isn't working, here are a couple of other ways to approach this:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Build and test your code in small chunks, making sure each chunk works before you add another one.</li>
                            <li>Create a 'break' point of sorts in your code by inserting a command for your SPHERE to do something abnormal, such as rotate 360 degrees. If the SPHERE executes your code and this abnormal action correctly in the simulation, then you know that your code, at least until the abnormal command, is working properly.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p><b>A1:</b> We recognize that these two buttons did not work previously, however as of 6/18/14 those issues should have been fixed.</p> 
                    <p>If you continue to have problems using the 'Save As' and 'Rename' buttons, please email your assigned ZR UROP student or the ZR Staff (<a href = "mailto:zerorobotics@mit.edu">zerorobotics@mit.edu</a>) and we will help you fix the problem.</p>
